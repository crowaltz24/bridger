# Bridger

Local LLM-powered reading assistant for dyslexia/ADHD users. Project for EPICS. 

## MVP

- Simplified text with reading aids
- Ollama API integration
- Font-safe styling
- Toggle between original/transformed text
- Popup controls

## Quick Start

1. Run Ollama locally and ensure the model exists (default: gemma3:1b due to speed, but you can switch to any you have)
2. Load the extension in browser
3. Select text on a page to transform it
4. Configure to liking with popup

## Notes

- Processing is local and privacy-first
- The extension does not override fonts
- We encourage using this alongside the OpenDyslexic extension
